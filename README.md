Predicting Floods using Classification
Why are floods a problem?
This is an important problem because floods pop up everywehre and about 85 people die from floods every year in the United States. Floods also cost The United States more than a 100 billion dollars a year. Although search parties are mainy volonteers, the USA still sometimes has to pay for some of the resources. If we are able to predict floods better than before, than we could save people's lives from drowning and even save money.

My Data
I found my data on Kaggle. The data I found had 20 catagories and I narrowed it down to the 5 most important ones. I chose River Management, Dams Quality, Drainage Systems, Coastal Vulnerability, and Watersheds. The data works well for this problem because it shows the importance of each catagory.I used a CSV file for my data. [https://www.kaggle.com/code/naiyakhalid/project-flood-prediction](url)

Approach
Originally, we tried to use linear regression to predict the floods but we realized that the data I chose was catagorical meaning it wouldn't work with linear regression. Then, we tried using classification where we decided to say 0 or 1 meaning no flood or yes flood. The classification code worked and we got 66.7% accuarcy on Logistic Regression. I tested Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multinomial NB. All of the codes worked and gave results that weren't the best but still gave me answers to the code. Supervise learning models are very useful when testing code and predicting important issues.

Deliverables
Code: data visualization, machine learning algorithms, predicted and classified floods. Report on the Project(ReadME) Presentation:Technichal Interview. 

Conclusion
These results tell me that the logistic regression worked the best with my data. Also, Random Forest  got me to 60% which is good for my first time making a project with Python. However, My models told me that logistic regression is the best one for my project. This means that this is a good start for me and for a good start to building a solution. Next, people could use data to realize and predict floods in the future.
